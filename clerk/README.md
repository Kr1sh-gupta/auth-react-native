## Updating Clerk Secret Key

To update the Clerk secret key used in this project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `app/_layout.tsx` file in your project directory.
2. Locate the section where the ClerkProvider is initialized.
3. Replace the `YOUR_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_KEY` with your actual Clerk frontend API key.

Example:

```tsx
<ClerkProvider frontendApi={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_KEY}>
```

Replace `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_KEY` with your actual Clerk frontend API key.

That's it! Your React Native app will now use the updated Clerk secret key.
```
